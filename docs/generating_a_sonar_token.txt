Here's how to generate a token:

1. Access SonarQube:
   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:9000`.

2. Log in:
   Use your admin credentials to log in. If this is your first time, the default credentials are:
   - Username: admin
   - Password: admin
   (You'll be prompted to change this password upon first login)

3. Go to User Settings:
   Click on your profile icon in the top-right corner of the page, then select "My Account" from the dropdown menu.

4. Navigate to Security tab:
   In your account page, you'll see several tabs. Click on the "Security" tab.

5. Generate Token:
   - In the "Tokens" section, you'll see a form to generate a new token.
   - Enter a name for your token (e.g., "Local Scanner Token").
   - Choose an expiration date if desired, or leave it as "No expiration" for a permanent token.
   - Click on the "Generate" button.

Remember, this token acts like a password, so keep it secure and don't share it publicly. If you suspect the token has been compromised, you can always revoke it from the same Security tab and generate a new one.
